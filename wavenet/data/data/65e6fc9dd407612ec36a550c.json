    "context": "The ISD mechanism was introduced under the GST framework to address the challenge of credit allocation in businesses with a centralized procurement system and decentralized operations. When input services are consumed across multiple locations of the same legal entity, distributing the Input Tax Credit (ITC) proportionately to the benefiting locations becomes essential for compliance and operational efficiency.",
    "objective": "To ensure fair and efficient distribution of ITC related to input services across branches of a business under the same PAN",
    "description": "<ol><li>ISD facilitates centralized management of Input Tax Credit (ITC) for companies with multiple branches, ensuring streamlined processes, without worrying about complex credit distribution.&nbsp;</li><li>ITC is distributed to branches based on their turnover, ensuring fair allocation and preventing misuse of credits​​.</li><li>&nbsp;It ensures ITC is allocated appropriately across branches, minimizing the cascading effect of taxes and improving cash flow management and reduction in cost</li></ol>",
    "how_to_apply": "<ol><li>Apply for a separate ISD registration via the GST portal under serial number 14 of the REG-01 form.&nbsp;</li><li>Designate a head office or any office as the ISD and register it under GST as an Input Service Distributor (ISD).&nbsp;</li><li>Collect invoices for input services used across branches or locations. Exclude ITC ineligible under Section 17(5) of the CGST Act.&nbsp;</li><li>Allocate ITC proportionally based on the turnover of each recipient branch during the relevant period. Issue ISD invoices or credit notes to distribute or adjust ITC among branches.&nbsp;</li><li>Declare the distributed ITC in the ISD return (Form GSTR-6) for compliance.</li></ol>",

    "additional_info": "<p>Formula for distribution of credit C1 = (t1÷T) × C where, C1 = ITC allocated to a branch. t1 = Turnover of the recipient branch in the relevant period. T = Aggregate turnover of all recipient branches. C = Total ITC available for distribution.&nbsp;</p><p>E.g., ABC Ltd, a baker, has paid bills of an advertising company amounting to Rs. 24 lakhs for advertising campaigns for two varieties of cakes, which are manufactured at separate locations in Pune and Bangalore. The company had a total turnover of Rs. 11,200 Lakhs in the previous financial year. The turnover of the Pune unit was Rs. 500 Lakhs, and the turnover of the Bangalore unit was Rs. 1,000 Lakhs. The aggregate turnover here is taken as Rs. 1,500 Lakhs, as advertising was for cakes, which are manufactured at these two units only. The ITC is to be distributed between Pune and Bangalore units in the ratio 1:2 (500 Lakhs:1,000 Lakhs). Therefore, Pune unit will be given ITC of Rs. 8 lakhs, and Bangalore unit will be given ITC of Rs. 16 lakhs from the advertising bills.</p>",
