Eligible enterprises must register separately under GST for manufacturing eligible products, and only this turnover will be considered for the subsidy. Trading or non-eligible services at the same business location will disqualify the enterprise from the subsidy. The resale of products is not eligible for turnover incentives.

Only new investments qualify for the incentive.",
