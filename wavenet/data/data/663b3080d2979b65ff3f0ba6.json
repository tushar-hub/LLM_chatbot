While, on the one hand, many opportunities have opened up for the small scale sector to enhance productivity and look for new markets in other countries, it has also put an obligation on them to upgrade their competence in terms of technology, management &amp; financial strength to successfully meet the global competition.</li><li>&nbsp;Therefore, there is a need to create awareness amongst Small-Scale Units about the strengths and weaknesses of their existing operations and to provide them an opportunity to enhance their organizational strengths. So a need was felt for introducing a Rating Scheme for the Small Scale Industries.</li><li>&nbsp;It is expected that the Rating Scheme would encourage SSI sector in improving its contribution to the economy by way of increasing their productivity, since a good rating would enhance their acceptability in the market and also make access to credit quicker and cheaper and thus help in economizing the cost of credit.</li></ul>",
