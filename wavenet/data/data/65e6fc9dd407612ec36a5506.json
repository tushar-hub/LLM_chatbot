    "description": "<ol><li>Simplified Compliance: Under the normal GST scheme, taxpayers must file multiple monthly/quarterly and annual returns and upload invoice details, which can be challenging for small businesses.&nbsp;</li><li>The Composition Scheme simplifies this by requiring only quarterly tax payments (CMP-08) and an annual return filing, reducing the compliance burden and allowing businesses to focus on growth.&nbsp;</li><li>Ease of Operations: The Composition Scheme eliminates the need for detailed record-keeping of ITC and complex tax calculations.&nbsp;</li><li>Taxpayers only need to calculate a fixed percentage of their turnover as tax, making it easy to manage compliance with minimal administrative effort.</li><li>Reduce tax liability:&nbsp;<ul><li>Another advantage of being registered with Composition Levy scheme is the rate structure.&nbsp;</li><li>While most of the services fall under either 12% or 18% GST bracket, Composition service providers need to pay tax as per the below rates:<ol><li>&nbsp;1% for manufacturers and traders (0.5% CGST + 0.5% SGST/ UTGST).&nbsp;</li><li>5% for restaurant services (2.5% CGST + 2.5% SGST/ UTGST)&nbsp;</li><li>6% for service providers opting for the composition scheme (3% CGST + 3% SGST/ UTGST).</li></ol></li></ul></li></ol>",
    "how_to_apply": "<ol><li>New Registration: Can opt for the scheme while applying for GST registration.&nbsp;</li><li>Existing Taxpayers: Must file Form GST CMP-02 before the start of the financial year.</li></ol>",
