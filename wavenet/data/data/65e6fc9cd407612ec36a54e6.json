The income declared under the scheme is treated as gross income, and no further expense deductions are allowed.&nbsp;</p><p>2. No Loss Carry Forward: If the business under Section 44AD incurs a loss, it cannot carry forward the loss to future years because the scheme considers the income as presumptive.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Withdrawal of Option: A taxpayer who opts for the scheme under Section 44AD cannot switch back to the regular taxation scheme for the next 5 years.&nbsp;</p><p>4. Presumptive Income: The declared income (8% of gross receipts/turnover) is considered the final income for tax purposes, and no further adjustments for expenses are permitted, making it a simplified process.&nbsp;</p><p>5. Digital Transaction Provision: If at least 95% of the total receipts are through digital modes (banking/electronic), then the deemed income is 6% rather than the standard 8%.</p>",
