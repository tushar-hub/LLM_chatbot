    "benefits": "<p>1. Ensures Minimum Tax Payment: The primary benefit of AMT is that it ensures that companies availing of tax exemptions or deductions still contribute at least a minimum amount of tax to the government’s revenue, thus preventing tax avoidance.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Tax on Adjusted Total Income: AMT ensures that companies that have large deductions but may not be paying adequate tax are taxed on a more consistent basis by taxing them on their adjusted total income.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Carry Forward of AMT Credit: If the AMT paid is higher than the regular tax liability, the excess AMT can be carried forward for 15 years to offset future regular tax liabilities. This allows companies to adjust the AMT paid against regular taxes in the subsequent years when their taxable income increases.&nbsp;</p><p>4. Incentive for Compliance: By ensuring that even companies claiming deductions pay a minimum tax, AMT encourages companies to comply with tax regulations without misusing exemptions.</p>",
